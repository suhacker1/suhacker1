Iâ€™m a software security engineer. My specialty is **machine learning assurance**, but my work also involves data privacy, program analysis, and applied cryptography. 

Right now, Iâ€™m an intern at **Trail of Bits** where I've worked on projects such as [PrivacyRaven](https://github.com/trailofbits/PrivacyRaven) and [Fickling](https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling). 

Iâ€™m pursuing a BS in Computer Science at **Georgia Tech** ([threads in theory and people](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/bachelors/computer-science/threads)) where I also conduct research under [Prof. Wenke Lee](https://iisp.gatech.edu/).
