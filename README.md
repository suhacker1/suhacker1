### Hi there!

Iâ€™m a security engineer focused on **trustworthy machine learning** and **privacy-enhancing technologies**. 
Iâ€™m also broadly interested in cryptography, program analysis, formal methods, and firmware engineering. 
Right now, Iâ€™m an intern at [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/).

Iâ€™m pursuing a BS in Computer Science, specializing in theoretical computer science and human-computer interaction ([Threads in Theory & People](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/bachelors/computer-science/threads)), at the Georgia Institute of Technology where I conduct computer security research under [Prof. Wenke Lee](https://wenke.gtisc.gatech.edu/). 

In addition, Iâ€™m a robotics engineer at the [RoboJackets RoboNav Team](https://robojackets.org/teams/robonav/), and I help organize a weekly [AI Privacy and Ethics Journal Club](https://aivillage.org/hacker-journal-club). 

Check out my [website](https://sshussain.me/) for more information.
