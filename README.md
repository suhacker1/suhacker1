### Hi there!

**Iâ€™m a privacy and security engineer primarily interested in trustworthy machine learning, applied cryptography, and program analysis**. Currently, Iâ€™m a security engineering intern at [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/). 

In addition, Iâ€™m pursuing a BS in Computer Science (Threads: Theory and People) at [Georgia Tech](https://cc.gatech.edu/) where I conduct research under [Prof. Wenke Lee](https://wenke.gtisc.gatech.edu/). Iâ€™m also a robotics engineer on the [RoboJackets RoboNav Team](https://robojackets.org/teams/robonav/).

Check out my [website](https://sshussain.me/) for more information.
