Hi! My name is Suha Sabi Hussain.

Iâ€™m a security engineer on the machine learning assurance team at Trail of Bits. Iâ€™ve worked on projects such as the safetensors security audit and fickling. I received my BS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech (with threads in people and theory).

You can contact me at suhashussain1 â€˜atâ€™ gmail â€˜dotâ€™ com or @suhackerr on Twitter.
